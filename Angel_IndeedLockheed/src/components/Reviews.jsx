        "Poor management and terrible benefits. The PTO they give us is insulting. 6 hours per month and 48 hours of sick time is given at the beginning of the year.",

      comment:
        "8% 401k match, ok pay (not the best but not horrible), 3% annual raise/bonus. Each department can be super different so keep that in mind for my review. The benefits and PTO are good (4 weeks accrual plus holidays and a week for Christmas).",

      comment:
        "The pros and cons are much like you'd expect from a large company. Leadership and company messaging is generally good, except where it isn't. Company strategy is good, and tools and processes are good if they're actually funded, used, and implemented. In some spots they're not.",

      comment:
        "What is the best part of working at the company? Work was steady, management wasn't all over us, and the pay was a bit above average. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Dealing with conflicting directions. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? Relaxed environment and easy to do daily.",
